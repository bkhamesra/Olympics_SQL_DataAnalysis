# SQL Capstone Project - Olympics DataAnalysis

In this repository, I have presented by results for SQL Capstone Project taken on CourseEra. As part of this project, I have analysed the Olympics games data. The goal of the project was to look for interesting insights into dataset which can be used for journalism. 

I have organized this project in three directories - 

1. Dataset - Contains list of dataset used for this work. 
2. Code - This includes set of jupyter notebooks with all the analysis. 
3. Presentation - a short presentation (keynote and pdf) decribing the project and results of the analysis.
